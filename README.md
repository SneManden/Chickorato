# Chickorato

An implementation of a "board game" inspired by LEGO's Kokoriko.

## About

The game will eventually feature up to 8-ish players.
When the game ends (the final, golden, egg is taken) the player with the highest
score (number of eggs + 3 for the golden egg) wins.

## Current state

 * _2014-11-23_: The game can be simulated with `AIsimple`.
    No player interaction yet. Cards are not introduced yet. Worm is neither.

## Comlete rules

Comming soon.
